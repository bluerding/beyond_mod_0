# Beyond Mod 0

I've learned so much over this last week, and it is most important to retain the information and to build off of that information. I am going to need to make some changes and be more strict on myself in these few weeks off in order to be preapred for Mod 1.

## Calendar Use

While I did put things in my calendar, I did not find myself using it how I intended to. It looked more like the Trello board, it had everything I needed to get done for the day in time slots, I just found myself not worrying about the time slots they were in. Now that I have a more clear understanding of how long things may take, I will schedule blocks more effectively. I will also make sure that I am working within those time blocks.
